# Laravel-Apparel-Store
This project is the Laravel version of my earlier MVC PHP e-commerce app. It uses Laravel Jetstream for auth, Livewire for interactive UI, Sanctum for API authentication, and MongoDB for handling API data. The goal is to move from a custom MVC setup to a modern Laravel stack with clean APIs and role-based access (Admin, Staff, Customer).
